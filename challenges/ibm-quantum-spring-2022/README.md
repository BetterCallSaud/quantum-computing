# IBM Quantum Spring Challenge 2022
### May 23 â€” May 28

The IBM Quantum Spring Challenge 2022 will be divided into two segments. One part will invite participants to tackle problems revolving around many-body systems, while the other will focus on fermionic chemistry simulations. Participants will get a one-of-a-kind opportunity to investigate problems at the forefront of quantum computing research.

Each exercise is presented as a Jupyter notebook which is hosted on the IBM Quantum Lab. All four exercises must be completed to finish the Challenge.

### Challenge Notebooks:

[1. Trotterization](./01.CM_trotterization.ipynb)

[2. Quantum Random Walk and Anderson Localization](./02.QRW_and_localization.ipynb)

[3. Many Body Localization](./03.many_body_localization.ipynb)

[4. Quantum Chemistry - Calculating Ground State of Water Molecule](./04.quantum_chemistry.ipynb)
